      <p>In the first week of the course I set up the foundations such as installing virtual studio, creating a github account and setting up a trello account. Throughout the week I learnt the basics of python starting from the  use of print and variables before moving onto things such as lists, loops, ifelse and creating functions. Considering I had no prior knowledge of coding before starting the course I was very happy with what I was capable of doing with python after only a week. </p>

<p class="left">In week 2 I was put into a small team where we created a text based adventure game together using the skill we learnt in week 1. We used trello to keep track of what needs to be done, what we are currently doing and what is complete. After we finished the game I decided to do some solo work where I experimented and made a quiz with a score system, the image shows one of the steps where you are asked to roll a dice and if it rolls a even numberyou gain a point.</p>

      <h3 class="clear center">Week 3</h3>
      <img class="floatright imgsize" src="html css.png" alt="HTML and CSS logo">
      <p>In week 3 I started to learn how to use HTML at a basic level such as creating paragraphs, headers and renaming the title of the webpage. Later I started learning about the basics of CSS and how you can use it to change the design of html pages. Both HTML and CSS were used in the design of this website.</p>
